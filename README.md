# Firestore CF3 Performance Testing
## Method

Measures the time to import the firebase functions library and process the trampoline
code in the onWrite event handler. A shard calculates this timing several times by
purging `require.cache`. This causes a memory leak which will eventually cause a worker
to die. A top-level function fans out a benchmark to multiple shards which may each
complete or run out of memory. After a successful run from N shards, basic stats
are calculated and displayed.

You can test this out by running `./test.sh <projectId>`

## Results
### TL;DR:
* p50: 17% savings
* p90: 21% savings
* p95: 68% savings
* p99: 21% savings
